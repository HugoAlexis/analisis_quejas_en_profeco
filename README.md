# Report of Complaints Filed with Profeco During 2023
The Federal Consumer Protection Agency (PROFECO) is a public agency of the Government of Mexico whose objective is to protect the rights of consumers, prevent abuses and guarantee fair consumer relations.

Each year, around 100 thousand complaints are filed with PROFECO by consumers against different companies. The objective of this project is to generate a report dashboard in excel to summarize and understand the main data of the complaints filed with PROFECO during 2023.

Among other data, this dashboard shows both specific information such as total complaints received or the Total amount claimed/recovered, as well as information about the companies with the highest number of claims, or the companies with the highest amount claimed. In addition, this information can be quickly filtered by various selectors such as the month of entry, the state where the complaint was made or the procedural status in which each complaint is found.
